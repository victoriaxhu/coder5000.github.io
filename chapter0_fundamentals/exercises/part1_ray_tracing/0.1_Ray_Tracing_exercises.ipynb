Unlike the examples above this is unlikely to be captured by syntax highlighting when you make a mistake, instead it's best to view this as an alternative to annotating the tensor shape. You may or may not prefer to use this.\n",

        "\n",
        "We'll be discussing more advanced ways to use GPT 3 and 4 as coding partners / research assistants in the coming weeks, but for now we'll look at a simple example: **using GPT to understand code**. You're recommended to read the recent [LessWrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ptY6X3BdW4kgqpZFo/using-gpt-4-to-understand-code) by Siddharth Hiregowdara in which he explains his process. This works best on GPT-4, but I've found GPT-3.5 works equally well for reasonably straightforward problems (see the section below).\n",
        "\n",
        "Firstly, you should get an account to use GPT with if you haven't already. Next, try asking GPT-3.5 / 4 for an explanation of the function above. You can do this e.g. via the following prompt:\n",

        "\n",
        "Is using GPT in this way cheating? It can be, if your first instinct is to jump to GPT rather than trying to understand the code yourself. But it's important here to bring up the distinction of [playing in easy mode](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nJPtHHq6L7MAMBvRK/play-in-easy-mode) vs [playing in hard mode](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hLWZf6kFkduecH2g/play-in-hard-mode). There are situations where it's valuable for you to think about a problem for a while before moving forward because that deliberation will directly lead to you becoming a better researcher or engineer (e.g. when you're thinking of a hypothesis for how a circuit works while doing mechanistic interpretability on a transformer, or you're pondering which datastructure best fits your use case while implementing some RL algorithm). But there are also situations (like this one) where you'll get more value from speedrunning towards an understanding of certain code or concepts, and apply your understanding in subsequent exercises. It's important to find a balance!\n",

        "#### When to use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4\n",
        "\n",
        "GPT-3.5 and 4 both have advantages and disadvantages in different situations. GPT-3.5 has a large advantage in speed over GPT-4, and works equally well on simple problems or functions. If it's anything that Copilot is capable of writing, then you're likely better off using it instead of GPT-4.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, GPT-4 has an advantage at generating coherent code (although we don't expect you to be using it for code generation much at this stage in the program), and is generally better at responding to complex tasks with less prompt engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Additional notes on using GPT (from Joseph Bloom)\n",
        "\n",
        "* ChatGPT is overly friendly. If you give it bad code it won't tell you it's shit so you need to encourage it to give feedback and/or show you examples of great code. Especially for beginner coders using it, it's important to realise how *under* critical it is.\n",
        "* GPT is great at writing tests (asking it to write a test for a function is often better than asking it if a function is correct), refactoring code (identifying repeated tasks and extracting them) and naming variables well. These are specific things worth doing a few times to see how useful they can be.\n",
        "* GPT-4 does well with whole modules/scripts so don't hesitate to add those. When you start managing repos on GitHub, use tracked files so that when you copy-paste edited code back, all the changes are highlighted for you as if you'd made them. (VSCode highlights changes with small blue bars next to the line numbers in your python files.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some things you can play around with:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Ask GPT it to write tests for the function. You can give more specific instructions (e.g. asking it to use / not to use the `unittests` library, or to print more informative error messages).\n",
        "* Ask GPT how to refactor the function above. (When I did this, it suggested splitting the function up into subfunctions which performed the discrete tasks of \"compute intersection points\")"

Essentially, the GPU (graphics processing unit) is a specialized processor for rendering graphics and doing other kinds of parallel processing.

You can use the `to` method to move your tensor between devices, e.g. `x = x.to(\"cuda\")` to move to the GPU, and `x = x.to(\"cpu\")` to move back to the CPU (or `x = x.cuda()` and `x = x.cpu()` as a shorthand). **CUDA** stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture, a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA which is supported by PyTorch. Note that this method returns a copy of the tensor rather than the tensor itself (unless the `to` command doesn't change its device). You can check whether CUDA is available by calling `t.cuda.is_available()` - if it's not, you can try installing a CUDA-supporting version of PyTorch from the [homepage](https://pytorch.org/).\n",

The most common way to do this is using the [Lambertian reflection model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambertian_reflectance), which says that the intensity of the light that reflects off a surface is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the light vector and the surface normal (or equivalently, proportional to their dot product, assuming both vectors are normalized).\n",

So far, our test functions have been pretty simple - we imported a test from the `part1_ray_tracing/tests.py` file, and ran it to compare our answers to the answers in `part1_ray_tracing/solutions.py`. This works perfectly fine, but there are other Python libraries which can make testing easier and more powerful. In particular, two such libraries are `unittest` and `pytest`. Both these libraries provide extensive features for modularizing and running test functions, and have nice integrations with VSCode. `unittest` is very powerful, but also has a steep learning curve and isn't worth the trouble of learning during a 6 week course. However, `pytest` is very useful and easy to learn, so we'll spend some time here discussing it.\n",

First, press the test icon on the left hand sidebar (it will look like a triangular flask). If this is your first time, then you'll need to click on the **Configure Python Tests** button, then select `pytest` as your framework (you may have to install pytest when prompted). This should automatically perform test discovery for you, showing you all the test files & functions in your current directory in the left hand window (it detects this the same way pytest does, using the `test_` prefix). You can hover over tests or files to see options like \"run test(s)\" or debug test(s)\". When you run them, you'll see a tick or cross appear next to the test, indicating whether it passed or failed.\n",
